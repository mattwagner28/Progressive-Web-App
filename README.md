# Progressive-Web-App
Bootcamp assignment to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria.

## Overview
To build this text editor, we started with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. We used a package called `idb`, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.

## Note
Our TA walked us through this assignment together during class
